# Escrow Payment System

The escrow payment system provides a secure way for customers to pay for services while ensuring service quality before releasing payment to service providers.

## Overview

The escrow payment system holds customer payments in a secure account until the service is completed successfully. This protects both parties:

- **Customers** have the assurance that they will only pay for services that meet their satisfaction.
- **Service providers** know that funds have been secured before they deliver services.

## Key Features

- **Secure Payments**: All transactions are processed through a secure escrow system
- **Payment Protection**: Customer funds are held in escrow until service completion
- **Release Mechanism**: Customers confirm service completion to release funds
- **Dispute Resolution**: Built-in dispute system for handling disagreements
- **Automatic Refunds**: Support for refunding payments when bookings are canceled

## Payment Flow

1. **Customer makes payment**: When booking a service, the customer makes a payment that is held in escrow
2. **Service delivery**: The service provider delivers the agreed-upon service
3. **Service confirmation**: The customer confirms the service was completed satisfactorily
4. **Payment release**: Funds are released to the service provider

## User Experience
